This is a simple match database for Tekken 8.

Currently there are options to add a match link, player 1 and player 2 that played in the set.  

Currently un-implemented is the ability to also add character 1/character 2 and search filters.

It is currently setup with SQLITE and by default should set up on localhost:7281
